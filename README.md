## 📖 Overview

**BioChem Academy** is a **learning management system (LMS)** focused on Chemistry education.  
The platform allows:
- Admins to manage content (Grades, Terms, Units, Lessons)
- Upload and organize **videos, images, and PDFs**
- Students to access content dynamically based on permissions
- Secure cloud-based video hosting through **Cloudflare R2**

This project combines **ASP.NET Core 9** for the backend API and **Angular 20** for the frontend UI.

## 🧱 Architecture

This project follows the **Clean Architecture** approach to ensure scalability, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

**Layers Overview:**

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Core** | Contains entities, enums, and interfaces (domain layer). |
| **Infrastructure** | Implements repositories and data access logic using EF Core. |
| **Application** | Includes DTOs, mapping profiles, and service-level business logic. |
| **API** | Exposes REST endpoints, handles authentication, and applies filters. |
| **AngularClient** | The front-end layer built with Angular 20. |

This structure allows for **independent testing and easy replacement of layers** (for example, switching the database provider or hosting platform).

## 🧩 Security & Permissions

The app implements **Access Control** to manage which student can access specific content.

| Level     | Example Action                |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Grade      | Grants access to all terms   |
| Term       | Grants access to all units   |
| Unit       | Grants access to all lessons |
| Lesson     | Grants access to a single lesson |

- Access is stored in the `AccessControl` table.  
- Free lessons are automatically visible to all users.  
- Revoking a Grade or Term removes all child-level access.  
- Global validation filters handle input validation and model state errors gracefully.  
- Global exception middleware ensures consistent API error responses.
